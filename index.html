                Life is all about learning and colouring. Learning through failures;
                learning through successes! And colouring your life with all
                those learnings. The more you learn, the more color your life
                gets. And here I'm, trying to learn about every new thing out
                there; trying to catch every little sunshine coming through my
                ways; making my own rainbows. And in between them, I do a bit
                of coding as well!! What? You don't belive that? Well try hiring
                me then! It's really that simple. Just click the button below and
                shoot a hi! I'll do the rest for you. cheers!!

                I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any
                simple website. I can even teach my grandma how to make
                simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn
                advanced topics.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote
                    web developer. I made their website and showed it to them.
                    They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working
                    at Programming Hero.
